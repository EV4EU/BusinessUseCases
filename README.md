Business Use Cases of the EV4EU Project - Task 1.5

The Business Use Cases (BUCs) are implemented in Sparx Enterprise Architect (EA) software using MODSARUS add-on. The available EA file descrives the business cases associated with utilizing the flexibility of EVs to provide services to various stakeholders, including transmission system operators (TSOs), distribution system operators (DSOs), and flexibility operators (FOs), also known as virtual power plants (VPPs). These business cases have been developed based on insights gained from dedicated workshops held under the Horizon Europe project "Electric Vehicles Management for carbon neutrality in Europe"(EV4EU).

The BUCs are modeled using the use case methodology proposed by IEC 62559-2:2015 to model and analyze the use cases associated with the utilization of EV flexibility. This systematic approach helps in understanding the interactions and functionalities involved in each scenario.

Use cases serve as the foundational elements for software engineering projects, outlining the systemâ€™s developed functionalities from both static and dynamic perspectives. The static aspect is presented by identifying the actors involved in the system, while the dynamic aspect illustrates the interactions between actors and the system through use cases.
